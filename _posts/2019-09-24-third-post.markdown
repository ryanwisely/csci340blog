there is a brain cell of mine that is completely dedicated to music. i'm an avid spotify user who makes countless playlists and mixtapes that contain songs from various types of genres.

i also have a radio show that airs on [khdx 93.1 fm](https://www.kdhx.fm). radio rewind! is now in its second year!

here are some of my favorite bands of all time:

1. half moon run
2. local natives
3. andy shauf
4. anderson .paak

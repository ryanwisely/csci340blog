  <p class="paragraph">"I listed customers, sellers, and items as my entities. I used user, sell, and submit as my actions to demonstrate all the significant components of the relationship. I am satisfied with my representation, though I am afraid it is incorrect. For instance,I tried to show in my draw.io diagram that both sellers and customers submit information, where the sellers submit the 5% of the item's final sale price as a tax to the website, and the customers have to submit bids online. Also, I tried to show how certain actions can be made under specific conditions, like how sellers can sell no items (in theory--though that would be inefficient!) or sell several items. But, they can only sell one item at a time. Also, when an item is sold, it can only be listed for sale by one seller, not multiple. I tried my best to use the appropriate notation styles accordingly.


  I am pretty satisfied with my data representation, even though I do feel like I might be missing one more entity or might have mislabeled an attribute for a primary key. </p>

welcome to my page.

that sounds personal, albeit generic, so i'll treat this website like a diary justto jot down some moans & groans as a computer science student--and the occasional hootin' and hollerin'--to remember such experiences i have endured as a nineteen year old sophomore, trying to maneuver a way through the pre-trial foreshadowing greys of life while in college.

while setting up the website, i struggled--big time--with my code editing applications. specifically atom. for some reason, the app stopped responding, refused to open back up, fall down the memory rabbit hole, was forced to uninstall it, reinstall again...everything was a disaster. i think it was in part from a storage problem on my hard drive since installing bundles on the command line also caused hiccups. this all just made the lab more confusing, but once communicating and reaching out for help, i begun to understand what i was supposed to be learning. i know that's the point of lab assignments, but you know what i mean: the gears were finally turning. but for a while there, i sure felt like a chicken with its head cut off!

generally speaking, i am definitely looking forward to learning more about front-end design, specifically

1. the javascript lingo

2. effective ui layouts

since i can learn and apply this directly through the group project i'm in, project paperweight. i admit i obviously need to know back-end too, but i'm not looking forward to it.

if you're no comp-sci guru, you can read more about the differences between [front-end](https://www.coursereport.com/blog/front-end-development-vs-back-end-development-where-to-start) and [back-end](https://www.upwork.com/hiring/development/a-beginners-guide-to-back-end-development/)

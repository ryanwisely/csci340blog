###### designing the site

using a custom template to style my blog was rather daunting because there's so much flexibility on what material i want to add to the website.

now **that** is a good thing, however, it requires a lot more meticulousness on the programmer's end to make sure all of the small, customized pieces are still intact and working.

this is my first experience with technical website design. it was hard navigating [markdown](https://www.ultraedit.com/company/blog/community/what-is-markdown-why-use-it.html) since this is the first time i've used it. throughout the lab i've had a look up a lot of [commands](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to make sure that what i'm typing is correct! to be fair, i still don't understand the point of the local server and how that works. and i also don't get which and why some files require markdown and some require html!

downloading all the files was a little overwhelming to look at, all at once, since i was scared to accidentally type something that would break the website. granted, none of this is rocket science--but it is computer science. hopefully i'll eventually understand the background components better as we get more in depth with the class later.

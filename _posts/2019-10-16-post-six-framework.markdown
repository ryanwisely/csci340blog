django- i really enjoyed learning about django since it is very similar to flask, the framework i had to research. like flask, django is written in python and easy to use, though it is more rigid in application style than flask. this framework probably won't be used for my group project.

express- since its intention is to "optimize throughput and scalability" for web developing, express uses javascript to help programmers do work at the minimum to perform at the maximum (Mozilla). most of its features come with plugins so it is very easy to customize to one's liking.

ruby on rails- this was the only framework that i had vaguely heard of before the semester started. ruby's object-oriented language i think would make it more difficult to implement, so i'm not sure how beneficial and effective this would be for the group project for hendrix learning domain website.

ASP.NET- it's written by microsoft, but i do like the universality of this could be used with windows, mac, or linux. i like how one could make the webpages dynamic by using razor (html/c#) and javascript.

laravel- this framework intimidates me the most out of all them because it is written in PHP, a language i am very intimidated of and clueless on how to use it. the demo in class, from what i remember, was very complicated from the structure of the set up. it was hard to understand why there needed to be more than one instance to connect the framework in the syntax???

i enjoyed following the tutorial on kahn academy for jQuery. it was very useful in guiding me in making the webpage for lab seven. while coding, though, it was frustrating at first to combine the three APIs while making them all work together simultaneously. it took quite a few attempts to make sure all the APIs were in sync, since sometimes the profile picture generated in the "catfish profile" would load accurately and precisely. on the other hand, the avatar pictures would load, but would do so sporadically.
